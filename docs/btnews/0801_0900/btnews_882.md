有朋自远方来。

2025年春节刚刚结束，一位新朋友走进马前卒工作室。他在经济舱和候机楼度过了48小时，曲折飞行几万公里，然后才绕过整个地球到达上海。除了宇航员，这是地球上离我们最远的人。

你好，您来之前我已经了解您的一些资料了，但是您可能还不了解我们这个节目，这里我想先做一点自我介绍。我和我这些同事在制作一个网络新闻评论的视频节目。

我们在各个平台有300万的关注量，关注者主要是20到35岁的青年男性。

我们每周三次，播出20分钟左右的视频，每期视频有40万到70万的播放量。

在电视和报纸衰落以后，我们在中国算是一个中等水平的媒体，很高兴和您能够在这个节目上交流。

### 乌拉圭足球印象
---
中国人对于乌拉圭最重要的一个印象，就是您这个国家的足球非常强，所以我第一个话题要和足球相关。

乌拉圭人口只有300多万，据我了解，目前所有得过世界杯的国家，乌拉圭应该是人口最少的一个。以您的各个国家的经历，乌拉圭的足球，或者说乌拉圭的社会和其他国家有什么不同？

First I want to thank you very much to for this interview.

And mostly because as you said your audience is about young people. You are right when you say about that Uruguay is very well known because it's it's football. Yeah.

And you know and one of the thing that is very impressive is how a little country with not more than 3 millions and a half people has won four World Championship in football. In 1924, 1928, 1930 and 1950.

I think that the the difference is between how important is football in Uruguay and how important is football in other countries. For example, in China football is not the main sport.

Football is not yet part of the Chinese way of doing and way of feeling. In Uruguay football is a feeling.

This is the difference because in Uruguay when you are a very little boy or girl, you start playing football in the schools, in your neighborhood.

对于中国人来说，乌拉圭算是世界上最遥远的一个国家，您是我见过的第一个乌拉圭人，所以接下来我可能会向您问一些关于乌拉圭相关的话题，让中国人更了解乌拉圭。

### 地广人稀与对外贸易
---
按照中国人的居住方式，乌拉圭这么大一片面积，我们要居住几千万甚至是上亿的人口，但是乌拉圭只有几百万人，您会认为自己生活在一个非常空旷的国家吗？

Yes, the territory is not little. Is I mean about 200,000 square kilometers.

And the population there is not proportional.

This means that Uruguay has a little domestic market.

And this is why Uruguay foreign policy is oriented to export in order to reach a broader market.

For example, China is the most the most important commercial partner of Uruguay.

Uruguay is the main for example beef exporter to China.

Uruguay is the first soybean exporter to China.

And is the first exporter of paper, pulp of paper to China.

China is supporting Uruguayan growth.

### 首都与地方差异
---
乌拉圭一半的人口聚集在首都，那么这个在首都生活和在乌拉圭其他的地方生活有什么不同吗？

Montevideo at all level is better, I mean education level, I mean social level is a little bit more than in the rest of the province.

But each province and each the cities of Uruguay has a good level of life.

### 南美富国与福利体系
---
Primary, secondary, up to the university level, people stay in the city and the province where they born. They born.

But after that, if you want to study in university, you have to move to Montevideo. There are few university in the province, but the main are in Montevideo.

And also Montevideo, the capital, offer more job opportunities than in the rest of the country.

从经济上来看，乌拉圭是南美洲最富裕的国家。您和您周围的人会感受到这一点吗？

People feels comfortable because Uruguay is giving to them job opportunities.

When you talk about education opportunity and when you talk about health care.

Every every Uruguayan people, since they born, has access to public health absolutely free. You don't pay one RMB and you have free access to education and to health care.

And believe me I used to live in Europe many years, in this case in Italy, and Italy at the same France or Spain, the United States don't don't have a the level of free education and the level of free health care as Uruguay has it.

### 社会矛盾与左翼政治
---
从我们的感受来说，乌拉圭是一个很和谐的国家。您作为乌拉圭的共产党人，应该是已经发现这个国家有比较明显的社会矛盾，您能否讲一讲您眼中的乌拉圭有哪些问题？

Uruguay as he says has of course its contradictions.

Uruguay is rich but the distribution is not equal.

Is not is still unfair. And this is what people, this is why people elected this again this new government.

And this new government again will be a government where the Communist Party of Uruguay is playing a very important role. Because it is a left coalition among all socialist party, communist party, progressive parties that is called Frente Amplio, Broad Front. And all are left left wing parties.

And one of the goal of this new government is to solve the contradiction that exists between rich people and less rich people.

The way to doing that is for example with fiscal issues, I mean tax issues. Uruguay tax the rich people, those farmers and producer and so on, and with that taxes support social policies.

### 香烟与大麻政策
---
我发现乌拉圭对吸烟管理很严厉，但是是可以合法吸大麻的，您对这件事怎么评价？

Yes, you know that former president of Uruguay that he passed away, he had been for two time president. The leader of the left party, his name was Tabaré Vázquez, has been very strict against tobacco.

And in Uruguay in the public places smoke is absolutely forbidden. After that Uruguay has been the first South American country that let smoke marijuana freely.

Also this has been decided by other left president called Mr José Mujica.

You know that the results of that legal marijuana smoking has been contradictory.

Because some people thinks that this is a way to let people freely use the if they want to smoke marijuana and marijuana is not dangerous as cocaine for example.

But also says that those who are in favor to let people smoke marijuana is is um way to combat the illegal traffic of marijuana.

Because all the this sector that it is very very dangerous about the traffic of drugs, cocaine and so on. In Uruguay still exists but is less dangerous because now that marijuana is free, they have not the chance to traffic with marijuana.

那您对现在这个大麻管理政策是支持还是反对？

Yes, yes, I support. I think that, uh you know that all these kind of decision there I mean are not beautiful in all the aspects, are not positive in all the aspect. But when at the end of the day when you made the balance, I mean it is uh the the things that are better are more important that the things that are bad.

The balance, I mean, and I think that the decision to let people freely smoke marijuana has been more benefit than dangerous.

But I personally I don't smoke marijuana.

I smoke tobacco, cigarettes.

### 社会治安问题
---
我看新闻报道，乌拉圭社会总体上很平静，但是似乎是因为巴西和阿根廷的犯罪影响，也有很多暴力问题，您作为普通人会感受到这些暴力吗？

It is absolutely true that violence in Uruguay is is a matter, is a problem. The same that in Argentina, I mean the same that in the rest of South America, not only Brazil and Argentina. And the government is doing it's not easy, it's not easy to struggle against violence. But is Uruguay is doing its best and is one also of the priority of the government is to eliminate the violence that exists, of course exists.

And you know that the violence has many things that stimulate the violence.

One is the poverty.

And this is why as I told you before, and this new government is one of its priority is to distribute the wealth in a more equal level.

### 嘉宾入党经历与个人选择
---
我之前看您的资料，提到您是参加过乌拉圭共产党，您是怎么加入党的？

I joined the Communist Party in 1971.

I was 16 years old and I I I was an student and have an important role, I play important role in the student trade union.

And I felt very attracted by how the Communist Party was doing at an student level.

And then as to become or to to to to improve my participation in the student trade union, I decided to become member and the party invite me to become member of the Communist Party.

可不可以在镜头前让观众看一下您的共产党党证？

This is my first Communist card.

This is the date when I became member of the Communist Party 1971.

Uruguay since 1973 up to 1985 has a dictatorship, a military government.

And to the the the the struggle against the dictatorship, the Communist Party that was illegal, I had been in jail and also I have to left, I had been sent out of my country.

@@@
我是承德市平泉人，大家应该听说过我家乡的特产杏仁露，适合冷饮，也适合冬天热饮，老人孩子都喜欢。前几天回承德拍节目，我采购了市面上所有品牌的杏仁露，倒在一样的杯子里，在我们编辑部组织了盲测。结论非常明显，乐野牌杏仁露最受欢迎，得票遥遥领先。我请南方的同事解释一下他们的选择。

如果你喜欢杏仁香味，乐野的味道是最浓厚的，而且一点异味都没有，完全没有用花生或者其他廉价坚果来顶替杏仁，我一喝就知道。

非常感谢好同学准确描述了乐野杏仁露的优点。我家乡平泉是重要的杏仁产地，从纬度来说也出产最优质的杏仁。乐野工厂就建在十万亩杏树的山下，所以能够收集最丰富的杏仁原料，每罐的平均用量是53颗杏仁。

杏仁露是植物蛋白饮料，和牛奶一样有浓醇的口感，还有蛋白质提供营养。和牛奶相比，它最大的优点是避免了乳糖不耐受。对于我这种喝鲜奶影响肠胃的人来说，杏仁露是不错的早餐备选。另外有些人的舌头比较敏感，喝太浓的牛奶会留下腥味，杏仁露就没有这个问题，完全是清爽口感，植物香味。

作为平泉土著，我一直想推荐家乡特产，可惜平泉过去是农业县，大多数产品没有标准化，质量不稳定。遇到乐野杏仁露之后发现，这是一种工农业结合的优质产品，而且跟得上时代，提供低糖型号。如果你也喜欢植物蛋白饮料，欢迎到评论区下单，支持马督工家乡的工农业发展。

### 国际视野：多边主义与中国角色
---
除了讨论国内话题之外，乌拉圭的共产党和左翼党派平时会怎么看待这个世界，看待国际局势？

The Uruguayan Communist Party and the left party in Uruguay feels very very involve and very close to the international affairs.

Uruguay support the multilateralism that China is promoting, not the unilateralism that United States want for them.

As it happened when the dissolution of the Soviet Union, United States think that they rule the world.

And this is not true.

Because not only China but other countries have to the right, the right to participate in the world decisions.

And this is I mean and the leader of this way of doing is China.

This is why Uruguay at a general level but mostly at the left the left party and mostly by the Communist Party feels very very close to the policies that international policy that China is developing.

### 联合国工作经历
---
能够介绍一下您后来到联合国工作的经历吗？您是怎样到联合国去工作的？

I used to be the Director General of an international organization called Devnet.

Devnet means Development Network.

This organization was the executed agency of the United Nation Development Program, United Nation Development Program. This organization has been engaged by United Nation to create a network for link the South countries, the global South and gave these countries to share technological and commercial information. It has been created before internet.

After that I used to work like senior consultant of the United Nation.

I had been engaged to develop programs, developing programs in Africa and South America.

### 见证中国发展奇迹
---
您来过中国几十次了，您去其他国家有这么频繁吗？

No, so often. My first time in China had been in 1989, September 1989. And then I had been tens of times.

One because I I am economist and I had been working with important Chinese companies in order to help them to go overseas.

Uh and also I work as consultant of provisional provincial and cities government in China.

This is at a professional level. I I feel very very close to to China. In 2010 I live in Shanghai the whole year because this organization that I told you before Devnet has its own pavilion in Shanghai World Expo in 2010. And this is when my book has been printed in China.

我大多数观众的年龄在20岁到35岁之间，所以您第一次来中国的时候他们还没出生。您能不能从您的角度介绍一下您观察中国这些年有什么变化？

My first time as I told you in China has been in 1989.

Then I had the chance and the honor to meet Mr Deng Xiaoping.

And also we had been invited to Shanghai.

And the then Mayor of Shanghai that then became Mr Zhu that then he became first minister of China, invite us to visit Shanghai.

And I remember that he described on told us about which were the plans to develop Shanghai.

And he show us which were the plans to build for example now is Pudong.

And believe me that in that time what your audience knows as Pudong were rice plants. Very hard to to achieve this in 10 years.

My second time was in 2000, 11 years later.

And when I took a flight from Rome to Shanghai, and when I land in Shanghai and I saw what was Pudong, I think I took the wrong flight because I can't believe that in 11 years all that the Mayor say that he will develop in Shanghai had been reached, has been done.

Your audience, the young Chinese people should know what is called the Chinese miracle.

Because and this is not only my opinion, what China has done in 40 years, no country in the history, in the human history has done.

您刚才提到您第一次来中国就见到了邓小平，您对他个人有什么记忆？

He received us, he host us in the people in Tiananmen Square, People Palace.

And he smoke a lot.

And he said that I have a nightmare.

How how to give to all the Chinese people the possibility to have two meals a days, a day.

And he say China will never never take the same road of reform as the the Soviet Union has walk by that road.

And I feel that he has a very strategic vision about how to solve the problem of China.

About how to give all the people the chance to eat two times a day as the minimum thing that you have to give to those people.

And as I told before, the results and this is why I think that Mr Deng Xiaoping is the in the last century the most relevant statement.

### 关于中国的新书
---
听说您已经写了一本关于中国的书，而且还在写第二本，我能够请您介绍一下您下一本书想表达的内容吗？因为我们毕竟绝大多数中国人都没有体验过从拉丁美洲或者是从南美洲来看中国的感受，我才有很多观众想读这本书。

Yes, as you say in 2010, it mean 15 years ago, I wrote my first book about China.

And I call this book China bridge a new era.

And this book has been printed here in China.

Why I title my book China bridge a new era? Because China has is changing but has already changed the world.

And in my and China bridge a new era for the the not only for China but for the world.

Now this book that I am already finished to write it is called the title is Discovering China.

What means discover is a Latin word, Latin word that means to move out what is covering.

You understand? And I think that the the the goal of this book is to move what is covering what people knows about China to show what is really doing, what is really happen in China.

The first chapter is called the 3C to understand China.

The first is civilization.

China is not only a nation state but also a civilization state.

The second C is Confucius.

Because China Confucius culture, Confucius philosophy is still alive and takes part of the political and ideological thinking of the Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party.

It is a mix between Marxism and Confucius. And this hybrid is very important to understand China.

Because for understanding China you have to understand also Confucius thought.

The third C is communist.

Because people thinks that China is not communist because China has I mean a developed market and they say that China is more capitalist than communist. And this is not true.

China has his is rule by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party is a Marxist Leninist and Maoist party.

And all all the strategy of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government is thought in order to make its own road for building a socialist country not a capitalist country.

It is I mean the the Chinese the socialism with Chinese characteristic as Mr Deng Xiaoping says.

The second chapter is called the reformer and the reform that change the world.

The reformer was Mr Deng Xiaoping. When Mr Deng Xiaoping launch what is called the process of reform and opening up, he change the world.

And reforming China the world start making its own change because China.

The third chapter is the democracy with Chinese characteristic.

Because also Western audience, Western thinkers says that China is not a democratic country.

But when they say that China is not democratic, they are thinking in the Western democracy model.

And the Western must understand that there is more than one model of democracy.

More than one, not only one model. And China has its own model of democracy.

And China, why China is also a democratic country? Because the result of Chinese policies has helped the people, serve the people say Mr Chairman Mao Zedong. And the democracy is the government of the people.

And if you are a democracy a democracy model when you serve the people and when the people support you. And Chinese people, it's not a matter of election but has shown that they support their government.

The fourth chapter is what I call the two shames.

Confucius said that there are two shames.

One is poverty.

And the second was the um that the the the the wealth is not well distributed.

That the the the wealth is concentrate in just a part of the population.

And Chinese reach to solve the two shames. Because in 2020 Chinese finish with the extreme poverty. There is no extreme poor in China.

This mean this this shame was cancelled.

And the second shame that is about the distribution of the wealth, China and mostly after the 20 Congress start what Mr Xi Jinping call the common prosperity. This mean that the prosperity of China must be distributed in a fair way. That the wealth arrive to all the people.

And that China must become a most prosperous society.

And this is what is happening in China.

And the fifth chapter I call a new dream for a new era.

Because since Mr Xi Jinping in 2013 five weeks after he has been elected Secretary General visiting the Beijing the National Museum of China place in Tiananmen Square he launched his proposal about the Chinese dream of rejuvenation of your country.

And this is I mean the most important political issue that China now is handling. Because the Chinese dream means that China will become in 2049 100 year after the the constitution of the Chinese the popular Republic the Chinese dream is to become a prosperous socialist country.

At technological level, economical level and political level. And this is why I focus the last chapter about how China is building and its Chinese dream.

### 中国的优点与缺点
---
因为我们很少和南美洲的人打交道，所以我非常想听到您的批评意见，就是无论是和乌拉圭还是和其他国家相比，您认为中国有哪些地方您认为是缺点，是需要改造的？

One problem that China has is that still now the government is making very strong efforts but the health care is not enough.

You have problem with the uh to spread the social network and give still more access to the social security.

You have problem. And you have problem in order to give all the Chinese as Uruguay is given the chance to have uh at all the level free education.

You know that one of the problem that young people in China has that is to access to the universities. They go cool. The examination is very hard. No all the young people have access to the level of education that they have the right to access.

Another problem that China is facing is and this is about the social contribution is that your population is aged.

And those that have more than 60, 70 years that worked for more than 40, 50 years, they don't have enough pension contribution that they deserve.

Another problem is the difference between the development of cities like Shanghai or cities in Guizhou province. And this is what China is trying to be more fair and support the development for example in Xinjiang province the effort that China is doing or with the West province in order to make a more fair distribution the wealth between the rich province and the more poor province.

This is a very critical problem for China because you see that the level of life between the West Chinese that lives in the western is very different that the level of life that you see in the east of China.

One issue is Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen. Another issue is the situation that you face in in Tibet for example.

What is important is that uh the problem exists, the contradiction exists, but in the other hand the government knows about this and is taken the measures to solve this contradiction.

对于中国来说，乌拉圭是最低调的国家之一，距离远，与世无争，安静的向国际市场供应牛肉，只是在世界杯前后才能偶尔成为焦点。希望今天的节目能够加深中乌两国人民的相互了解。
